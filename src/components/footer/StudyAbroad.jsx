              <h2><strong>STUDY IN THE UK</strong></h2>
              <br></br>

              <img src="https://leverageedublog.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/23171737/Modern-Education.png" height={350} width={700} alt='' />
              <br>
              </br>
              <ul><h4><strong>Why Study in the UK</strong></h4></ul>

              <br />
              <ul>
                <p>The UK is a popular study destination for international students due to the high quality of education and the global recognition of UK universities. The QS World University Rankings is a well-respected ranking system that provides an overview of the world’s top universities, and the UK is well-represented in these rankings with 76 universities featured. Additionally, several UK universities are ranked in the top 10 globally, including the University of Oxford, the University of Cambridge, Imperial College London, and University College London.</p>
                <p>UK universities have made it clear that they remain open to students from all over the world, including the EU, and are committed to maintaining their status as world-class institutions of higher education. Despite the ongoing uncertainties surrounding Brexit, the UK government has reiterated its commitment to ensuring that the country remains an attractive destination for international students, and has made a number of changes to visa regulations and other policies to make it easier for students to study in the UK. </p>
              </ul>
              <br></br>

              <h4><strong>Education System in the UK</strong></h4>
              <br></br>
              <p>Undergraduate degree programs in the UK typically last three years, but some programs such as engineering, science, and social science may last four years. During the third year, many UK universities offer a placement year, also known as a “sandwich year,” where students can gain work experience in their field of study. This can be a valuable opportunity for students to develop practical skills and gain a deeper understanding of their chosen profession.</p>
              <p>Postgraduate courses in the UK usually last for one year and involve attending lectures, seminars, and workshops, as well as working on assignments, projects, and dissertations. Students are usually assigned a tutor who provides academic guidance and support throughout the course. Assessment is usually done through a combination of exams, essays, projects, and presentations.</p>
              <p>Admission to top UK universities is highly competitive and often based on academic qualifications and certain standardized tests. For undergraduate courses, applications are made through UCAS, while postgraduate applications are made through UKPASS. Students can apply to up to 5 different universities in one application and can only make one application per academic year. </p>
              <p>The process for applying to undergraduate courses may differ from that of postgraduate courses. Indian students seeking to study in the UK can apply to numerous universities based on their eligibility and preference. While some universities have an application fees there are some where the fees is not mandatory.</p>
              <br></br>



              <h2><strong>TUITION FEES AND LIVING EXPENSES</strong></h2>
              <br></br>

              <h4><strong>Cost of Studying</strong></h4>
              <br></br>
              <p>The average cost of study in UK for undergraduate student is 12,000 pounds</p>
              <p>Foundation courses – 4,000-12,000 pounds</p>
              <p> Arts courses – 7,500- 10,000 pounds</p>
              <p>Science courses -7,500-22,000 pounds</p>
              <p>Clinical courses 15,000-30,000 pounds</p>

              <br></br>
              <h2><strong>MBA</strong></h2>
              <br></br>
              <p>A two year management degree expands to Master of Business Administration, only Universities can grant MBA degrees. It could be foreign university or Indian University.</p>
              <p>MBA stands for Master of Business Administration. It is a postgraduate degree program that focuses on developing skills and knowledge in business and management. </p>
              <br></br>

              <h2><strong>FURTHER ENLIGHTENMENT</strong></h2>
              <br></br>
              <p>Let us help you understand the basic difference between the two in India-:</p>
              <br></br>
              <p><strong>1.Only universities can offer MBA:</strong> In India, only management institutes that are affiliated with a university can offer an MBA degree. For this reason, institutes like NIMT Institute of Hospital & Pharma Management and NIMT Institute of Management can offer an MBA degree as they are affiliated with Mahamaya Technical University and Rajasthan Technical University, respectively. Additionally, even though the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs) are considered the best in the country, they cannot offer MBAs since they are not affiliated with any university. Institutes that are not affiliated with universities are autonomous and can offer a Post Graduate Diploma in Management (PGDM) degree. However, these programs must be approved by regulatory bodies such as the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE).</p>
              <p><strong>2.Difference in focus of curriculum:</strong> Although there are significant similarities in the curriculum of MBA and PGDM, there are subtle differences between the two programs. MBA programs generally emphasize the theoretical aspects of management and are more exam-oriented, while PGDM programs have a stronger focus on developing soft skills and are geared towards industry requirements, making graduates better prepared for the job market.</p>
              <p><strong>3.Curriculum of PGDM is flexible: </strong>As autonomous institutes are not required to follow university standards, they have the flexibility to modify their curriculum in accordance with industry standards and changes in the business environment. This also allows PGDM programs to provide greater exposure to industry practices. In contrast, MBA programs affiliated with universities must adhere to the university’s guidelines and changing their curriculum can be a lengthy process. Therefore, it can take a considerable amount of time to adapt MBA programs to evolving industry needs.</p>
              <p><strong>4.MBAs are more affordable:</strong> Compared to PGDM programs, MBAs are generally more affordable, as their fees are usually comparable to university standards.</p>
              <br></br>


              <h2><strong>Executive MBA</strong></h2>
              <br></br>

              <ul>
                <img src="https://images.shiksha.com/mediadata/images/articles/1652690437phpYCDvB5.jpeg" height={350} width={700} alt='' />
              </ul>

              <br></br>
              <p>Executive Master (EM) or Master of Advanced Studies (MAS) is an advanced level of master’s degree designed especially for mid-career executive professionals. Common titles of the degree are executive master of arts, executive master of science or area specific titles like executive master of business administration, executive master of communication or Executive Master of Advanced Studies in Humanitarian Logistics and Management (MASHLM), etc.</p>
              <p>Executive master’s programs are typically designed for full-time working professionals and therefore have schedules that cater to this demographic. Most executive master’s programs consist of several full days (not more than a week) per month for a period of two or three years. However, some programs offer similarly adapted schedules with classes held only on nights or weekends. The most condensed of such programs can be completed in as little as a year. According to the Bologna system, program participants are required to earn 60 ECTS to complete the degree. In other systems, the duration of the program is dependent on the total number of academic credits and the number of course credits that can be completed in a given semester.</p>
              <p>Executive Master of Science in Communication (EMScom, MScom) programs are designed for communication professionals who have significant experience in the field and want to advance their careers. The programs are structured similarly to EMBA programs, with short learning sessions scheduled around the needs of working professionals. The curriculum typically covers general management topics as well as communication-specific themes such as crisis communication, stakeholder management, media relations, and digital communication.</p>
