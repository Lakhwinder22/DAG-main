                <p>The first point of contact for me during my journey was Ms. Sanjam. She helped me out in editing my Statement of Purpose and other specified details in my Resume. She was available 24*7 along with Sagar Sir, providing me ample suggestions and aid in sitting for my interview rounds. DAG also helped me out in finding a part-time post my arrival in London and kept a constant check on me, if there was any help required.</p>
