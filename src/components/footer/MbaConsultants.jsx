                            <br></br>
                            <p>We’ve helped admissions consulting clients in India, USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Singapore,<br>
                            </br> Germany, South Korea, Hong Kong, China, UAE, South Africa, Japan, Spain, Nigeria, Cameroon and many other countries
                            </p>
                            <p>Whether you are applying to the top international MBA programs or the best Indian business schools,<br></br> our MBA consultants have stellar credentials and in-depth knowledge of the entire MBA admissions process.<br></br> They’ve managed not only to get into the top MBA colleges with the toughest selectivity rates but also graduate with flying colours.</p>
                            <p>They also have impressive accomplishments in the corporate world, having worked for many leading organisations (including McKinsey, IBM, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Citigroup).<br></br> They’ve worked in multiple industries and donned many hats as well – ranging from strategy consulting to mergers & acquisitions. Incidentally,<br></br> strategy consulting and Investment Banking are the most coveted post-MBA careers for many MBAs.</p>
                            <p>They’ve managed to use their MBA degrees to facilitate complete career transitions. In short,<br></br> they’ve managed to accomplish what most prospective MBA candidates from India expect from a top-notch MBA program.</p>
                            <p>But the personal and professional successes of our MBA consultants aren’t what makes them favourites among MBA aspirants.<br></br> It’s what they’ve been able to do for their clients that makes them special. Since inception,<br></br> we’ve never used paid advertising to promote our services. Word-of-mouth publicity works best for us.</p>
                            <p>And it doesn’t hurt to get the occasional pat on the back from highly credible and respected publications like Poets & Quants <br></br> [Read their review of Direct Admission Global placing us in the same league as the other international admission consultants in the world].</p>
                            <p>Our team is very small, which allows us to run the venture like a boutique (less clients, highly focussed, personalised approach) as opposed to the big teams that work like a factory.</p>
                            <p>We follow a virtual operating model, the same process that the best MBA admissions consultants in USA follow.<br></br> Whether you are based in Delhi NCR, Bangalore, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Pune, Kolkata or any other city in India or abroad, seek out the best MBA consultants globally.<br></br> Compare the profiles of our top MBA consultants with those across the street and take a decision. When your future career is at stake, who do you want to partner with?</p>
